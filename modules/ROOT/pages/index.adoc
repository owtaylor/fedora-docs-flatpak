= Flatpak

https://flatpak.org[Flatpaks] are a new way of deploying applications. If you have an application already packaged as a Fedora package, creating Flatpak offers a number of advantages:

* The application can be safely updated without rebooting the system (you can update a package without rebooting your system using dnf from the command line, of course, but GNOME Software only offers updating applications as part of an offline system update.)
* The application can seamlessly be installed on Fedora Silverblue
* The Flatpak works across all supported Fedora versions - you donâ€™t have to update trailing versions of Fedora for people to use the newest application version.
* The Flatpak can be run by people running on other distributions
